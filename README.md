# APitems-LOL
An Entry for the LOL API Contest

The project contains a general solution with 3 projects.

An API Data retreival project which uses the LOL Api to populate a MySQL Table.


A Data project to manage the connection with MySql.


And a Web Project for the Web View (I'm currently deploying the site so it might not be available yet).
