# APitems-LOL
An Entry for the LOL API Contest

The project contains a general solution with 3 projects.

An API Data retreival project which uses the LOL Api to populate a MySQL Table.


A Data project to manage the connection with MySql.


And a Web Project for the Web View I hosted on http://201.231.163.73:3000/ (Had a lot of troubles deploying to a free web host, so it's active in my computer, it may go a bit slow and might no be active 24/7, sorry about that :) ).

About the Web Project.
It's a web with statistics about the surveyed sample in games (only NA for 5.11 - 5.14). 
It fetches the statistics of the selected Rank/Role/Champ and shows them in:

A Chart for the Average AP/MR in both Patches.

A Chart for the Lifetime of the items affected in AP rework.

And a Table for item pickrate comparison per minute.
